### TENSORFLOW.JS
Tensorflow.js is an open-source library enabling us to define, train and run machine learning models in the browser, using Javascript. For more information about Tensorflow.js, check out its [official webpage](https://js.tensorflow.org/). I will use Tensorflow.js library in Angular to build a Web App which detects multiple objects on webcam video feed.

### COCO-SSD MODEL
First, we have to select the pre-trained model which we are going to use for object detection. Tensorflow.js provides several pre-trained models for classification, pose estimation, speech recognition and object detection purposes. Check out all the [Tensoflow.js pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models) for more information.

### RUN

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.9.


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
